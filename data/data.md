I got data from kaggle.

[Brain MRI segmentation](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation)

The data consists of 4000 images and masks each.

Here are samples of images and masks.

I resized them 512 by 512 to input to the model and some augmentations were applied like here.
